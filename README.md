# CS330L Bonus Lab

For this bonus lab, I made a basic React webapp detailing some of the coding projects I have completed.

The app features some basic information and 3 cards describing different coding projects. Each card has a "View Details" button that contains more information or comments about the respective projects, and links if applicable.

The navbar at the top of the page has an animation to expand and collapse the app's pages.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Note that you may have to run 'npm install' to get the necessary dependencies'.
